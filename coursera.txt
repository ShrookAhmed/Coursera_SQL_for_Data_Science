Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category
 by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars 
and answer the following questions. Include your code.

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?


No, distribution of hours 

select city,count ( hours),sum(review_count),
CASE WHEN stars > 4.0 THEN '4-5 stars'
            WHEN stars > 3.0 THEN '3-4 stars'
            WHEN stars > 2.0 THEN '2-3 stars'
            ELSE '< 2' END AS 'STAR'

 from business join  hours on
business.id = hours.business_id
where city = 'Toronto'
group by star
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes         
select city,count ( hours),sum(review_count),
CASE WHEN stars > 4.0 THEN '4-5 stars'
            WHEN stars > 3.0 THEN '3-4 stars'
            WHEN stars > 2.0 THEN '2-3 stars'
            ELSE '< 2' END AS 'STAR'

 from business join  hours on
business.id = hours.business_id
where city = 'Toronto'
group by star
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Location data inconclusive as related to how a business is rated 

sql command

select city,count ( hours),sum(review_count),
CASE WHEN stars > 4.0 THEN '4-5 stars'
            WHEN stars > 3.0 THEN '3-4 stars'
            WHEN stars > 2.0 THEN '2-3 stars'
            ELSE '< 2' END AS 'STAR'

 from business join  hours on
business.id = hours.business_id

group by star
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

business that are open have more reviews than that are closed           
      
ii. Difference 2:
    The sum star rating is higher for businesses that are open than
		businesses that are closed.  
         
SQL code used for analysis:     
         
SELECT name, city, sum(stars),sum( review_count), is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
ORDER BY stars DESC
ORDER BY stars DESC


3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

What is the most successful category of business?

        
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

 I calcalate the average of stars and the proportion of opening on each category. 
                          
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+------------------------+--------------+-----------+------------+
